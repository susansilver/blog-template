title: A Writer's Illicit Love Affair With Mathematics
---

This post was published to Medium in 2015. It was test to see if people would be interested in anecdotes about mathematics. The style of storytelling that I wanted to go with. More like a memoir than an explanation of serious math. I thought that if people could resonate with my feelings that they might consider their own about mathematics.

This essay was featured in **The Synapse**. A popular publication about education at that time. I would go on to start writing at Beauty of Mathematics in 2018. This article is a republish of the original with some editing.
