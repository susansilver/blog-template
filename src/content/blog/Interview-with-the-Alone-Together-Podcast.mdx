title: Interview with the Alone Together Podcast
---

Alone Together is a podcast hosted by Canadian Journalist Peg Fong. She found me via a search for "One is the Loneliest Number". I have a [bio post on Harry Nilsson](https://beautyofmathematics.com/one-harry-nilsson/ 'Article on Beauty of Mathematics discussing the song One and the legacy of Harry Nilsson') all about the song which is called "One". Nilsson's is the original though the cover by Three Dog Night is more well-known. This interview covers the origin of my love for mathematics.
