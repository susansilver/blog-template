One of my hobbies is designing and developing websites. Although popular, WordPress is way more than I need to publish my blog. There are a lot of cons including web performance and security issues.

I suggest that writers switch to a static site generator like Astro.

It is a new framework for building modern websites that ships zero JavaScript out of the box. You can sprinkle in your interactivity in ways that won't slow things down.

Bring your own UI framework! Astro supports Svelte, Vue, and React. And a whole lot more. Even vanilla JavaScript (which is all I use.)

This is [my argument for leaving WordPress](https://www.suzza.dev/one/wordpress/ 'Reasons to consider leaving WordPress').
